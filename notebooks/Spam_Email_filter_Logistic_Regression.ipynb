    "### Introduction\n",
    "The use of emails for communication has been growing consistently in the digital era. However, unwanted emails such as ads and scams have also been growing in tandem. This do not only fill up the mail box, but some are also attempts at scamming and when successful, they may lead to financial losses or the leaking of sensitive data. To counter this, machine learning has been used to classify emails as either spam or not spam, and move the spams to a dedicated folder where they can be deleted.\n",
    "We implement a machine learning algorithm that can be used to filter emails based on a logistic regression."

    "### Objective\n",
    "The objective of this exercise is to develop a machine learning algorithm that can classify an email as a spam or not spam. We will use the Spam Emails Dataset for Classification and Filtering downloaded from Kaggle. [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/abdallahwagih/spam-emails]\n",
    "This dataset contains a collection of emails, categorized into two classes: \"Spam\" and \"Non-Spam\" (often referred to as \"Ham\"). These emails have been carefully curated and labeled to aid in the development of spam email detection models."
