## Spam Email Filtering System

### Overview
This project is a Spam Email Classifier built using Machine Learning. The classifier distinguishes between "spam" and "ham" (non-spam) emails. It uses different machine learning models, including Logistic Regression, Linear Regression, and Perceptron, to accurately predict whether an email is spam or not. The project includes two separate Python applications: one for Logistic Regression and another for Linear Regression.
